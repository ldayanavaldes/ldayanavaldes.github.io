## 🛠️ Stack

- [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) - The next-generation web framework.
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with type syntax.
- [**Ninja Keys**](https://github.com/ssleptsov/ninja-keys) - Dropdown menu with keyboard shortcuts created in pure JavaScript.

## 🚀 Get Started

### 1. Use this [repo](https://github.com/midudev/minimalist-portfolio-json) as an Astro project template

- I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as a package manager and bundler.

```bash
# Enable pnpm on MacOS, WSL & Linux:
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate

# Initialize the project
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template dsantafe/dsantafe.github.io
```

### 2. Add your content:
Edit the cv.json file to create your own printable Portfolio/CV.
### 3. Launch the development server:

```bash
# Enjoy the result
$ pnpm dev
```

1. Open http://localhost:4321 in your browser to see the result 🚀
